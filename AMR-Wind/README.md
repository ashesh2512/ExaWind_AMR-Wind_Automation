# TLDR
This base file is setup in the format so that you can declare all necessary variables to run AMR-Wind in one file, and by running the "base\_file\_transform" code you can generate the needed 3 input files (Spinup, Precursor, and Turbines) to run AMR-Wind. To use the transformation code, you MUST change the output\_folder variable to the location of your base file alongside changing the precursor\_file\_name to match that of your base file name. Both these variables are at the very top of the transformation code. Then simply run the code (I used VScode).

This code was developed by myself as a part of an internship with NREL's Wind Energy Science group with mentorship from Ashesh Sharma through the GEM fellowship. Any questions can be direcred to sydrich@stanford.edu as I will no longer access my NREL email.
